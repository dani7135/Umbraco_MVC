After you clone the project you have to add a migration to run it. 
You're doing it by adding  migration, so go to tools. Then NuGet Manager Console and then click on the first "package manager console".

In the package manager Console you are writing Add-Migration Number
After that you are writing Update-Database
And now you can start the program and it works :)
